**Data species** refers to the type of organism being analyzed, such as mouse 'mm10', human 'hg38', rat 'rnor6', or a custom reference.

**Gene Annotation:** Gene annotation is the process of identifying the locations of genes and other features in a genome, and determining their functions. 

**Arrow Files:** Arrow files are a binary file format used to store columnar data. Arrow files may be used to store the results of gene annotation.

**Maximum Fragments:** Maximum fragments refer to the maximum number of DNA fragments that can be used for gene annotation.

**Add Tile Mat:** The add tile mat function is used to add a tile matrix, which is a matrix of values indicating the presence or absence of a particular feature (such as a gene) in a given region of a genome.

**Add Gene Score Mat:** The add gene score mat function is used to add a gene score matrix, which is a matrix of values indicating the likelihood that a particular region of a genome contains a gene.
